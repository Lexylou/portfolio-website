                    <p>Hello, I’m Alexa and welcome to my portfolio! I am a detail-oriented and highly motivated professional who graduated in May of 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering and minors in Entrepreneurship and Mathematics. After graduating, I held a 
                        position as a Field Account Executive for an occupational health company. I learned a ton through this experience but have decided to further grow in a profession where I can utilize my strong problem-solving skills along-side my creativity. I have discovered 
                        my passion for front-end engineering through an online coding platform, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" class="thick-underline" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>, where I have learned and continue to build the skills and many aspects that make up this exciting field. With all the new skills I am 
                        developing (no pun intended, really), I can't wait to become a front-end developer!
                    </p>
                    <p> I enjoy working on projects where I can use my clever and critical thinking skills to overcome various types of challenges. I am an analytical and numerically driven individual and find numbers to be my strong suit. I am also adaptable and work well 
                        in teams, so I thrive in environments where I can collaborate with others to generate the best and most innovative outcomes. I always give it my all, work hard, and maintain a positive attitude in everything that I do. Afterall, these things (along 
                        with a touch of planning, of course) allow me to achieve my goals, no matter how large or daunting a task may be! As someone who is self-motivated and teachable, I catch on to new things quickly and with ease. Having a natural curiosity allows me to 
                        further dive into new concepts on my own, demonstrating the ability to efficiently self-learn. In fact, it is this curiosity that drove me to learn more about front-end engineering to begin with! 
                    </p>
                    <p>In my free time I enjoy working on web development/coding projects (both individual and Codecademy inspired) that allow me to learn new skills and strengthen the skills I have. I also enjoy completing DIY and other art projects, assisting friends/colleagues 
                        in anything math related (I know, I know, “Who enjoys that” right? I just genuinely love math!) and partaking in outdoor activities such as hiking and playing golf.
