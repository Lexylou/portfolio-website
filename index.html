                    <p>Hello, I’m Alexa and welcome to my portfolio! I am a detail-oriented and highly motivated professional who graduated in May of 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering and minors in Entrepreneurship and Mathematics. After graduating, I held a 
                        position as a Field Account Executive for an occupational health company. I learned a ton through this experience but have decided to further grow in a profession where I can utilize my strong problem-solving skills along-side my creativity. I have discovered 
                        my passion for front-end engineering through an online coding platform, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>, where I have learned and continue to build the skills and many aspects that make up this exciting field. With all the new skills I am 
                        developing (no pun intended, really), I can't wait to become a front-end developer!
                    </p>
                    <p> I enjoy working on projects where I can use my clever and critical thinking skills to overcome various types of challenges. I am an analytical and numerically driven individual and find numbers to be my strong suit. I am also adaptable and work well 
                        in teams, so I thrive in environments where I can collaborate with others to generate the best and most innovative outcomes. I always give it my all, work hard, and maintain a positive attitude in everything that I do. Afterall, these things (along 
                        with a touch of planning, of course) allow me to achieve my goals, no matter how large or daunting a task may be! As someone who is self-motivated and teachable, I catch on to new things quickly and with ease. Having a natural curiosity allows me to 
                        further dive into new concepts on my own, demonstrating the ability to efficiently self-learn. In fact, it is this curiosity that drove me to learn more about front-end engineering to begin with! 
                    </p>
                    <p>In my free time I enjoy working on web development/coding projects (both individual and Codecademy inspired) that allow me to learn new skills and strengthen the skills I have. I also enjoy completing DIY and other art projects, assisting friends/colleagues 
                        in anything math related (I know, I know, “Who enjoys that” right? I just genuinely love math!) and partaking in outdoor activities such as hiking and playing golf.

                            <li>Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with inspiration from multiple projects I have completed on Codecademy, I created an interactive game of rock, paper, scissors. I further developed functions I had previously written, and I 
                                utilized resources and guidance from supplemental code on Codecademy’s projects along with my knowledge of the DOM (document object model) to successfully integrate this game into my website. When I would get stuck, I used the 
                                console in Chrome Dev Tools to troubleshoot and effectively debug my code to ensure my game was working as expected. This process allowed me to better understand real applications of writing JavaScript code to interact with the 
                                DOM and increased my comfortability with writing code to add engagement and improve the user experience of my website. Ultimately, this experience got me more excited for future projects I will complete utilizing HTML, CSS, and 
                                JavaScript all together!
